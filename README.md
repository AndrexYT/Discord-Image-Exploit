# Discord-Image-Logger
A exploit I found in discord. Working as of now.
# Explanation
The program simply detects when discord is sending a get request for a preview of the website based off the ip address and will send a fake image. 
But when a actual user clicks the link it will detect that and send a malicious file instead. But in no way does the program actually execute the executable. This simply a showcase for the exploit and not very practical for actual hacking
# Usage
The "YourImageLink" needs to be replaced with a link to a image example: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924433694133993482/938260977164632094/s.png. While the "MaliciousFIleDownloadLink" needs to be replaced with a download link to the file. example:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924433694133993482/938262761337671741/bad.exe
Whenever someone clicks the image and hits "Open Origanal", right clicks the image and presses open link, or just click the image with their middle mouse button the file malicious file will download. Although it won't execute as I said before
If you want to host your website globally i'd recommend using replit (https://replit.com)
