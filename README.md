# Discord-Image-Logger
A exploit I found in discord. Working as of now.
# Explanation
The program simply detects when discord is sending a get request for a preview of the website and will send a fake image. 
But when a actual user clicks the link it will detect that based off their ip and send a malicious file instead. But in no way does the program actually execute the executable. This simply a showcase for the exploit and not very practical for actual hacking
